## Hi there 👋

Good evening everyone, my name is **Xavier Rogers**. I am currently a 4th-year computer science major concentrating in **AI, Robotics, and Gaming** with a minor in mathematics at the **University of North Carolina Charlotte**. After graduating, I will be working at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as a **Solutions Architect** in Austin, Texas.

In tandem with my studies, I am also the **Founder and Owner of WhatsTheWord, LLC**. I am building a college social app, **WhatsTheWord**, which is meant to bridge the gaps between college students and student networks through the use of:

- Personalized news feeds.
- Lounge rooms where students can chat and post content to each other.
- A buzzing events feed where students can see the latest events happening on campus.

For more information about WhatsTheWord and to sign up for the prelaunch, please visit [whatstheword.live](https://whatstheword.live) and sign up for early access via the email signup at the bottom of the site or by clicking the "Get Early-Access" button.
