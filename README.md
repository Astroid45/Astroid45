## Hi there üëã

Good evening everyone, my name is **Xavier Rogers**. I am currently a 4th-year computer science major concentrating in **AI, Robotics, and Gaming** with a minor in mathematics at the **University of North Carolina Charlotte**. After graduating, I will be working at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as a **Solutions Architect** in Austin, Texas.

In tandem with my studies, I am also the **Founder and Owner of WhatsTheWord, LLC**. I am building a college social app, **WhatsTheWord**, which is meant to bridge the gaps between college students and student networks through the use of:

- Personalized news feeds.
- Lounge rooms where students can chat and post content to each other.
- A buzzing events feed where students can see the latest events happening on campus.

For more information about WhatsTheWord and to sign up for the prelaunch, please visit [whatstheword.live](https://whatstheword.live) and sign up for early access via the email signup at the bottom of the site or by clicking the "Get Early-Access" button.

## Keystone Projects üåü

### AWS Container Marketplace Pipeline  
As part of my internship, I designed and implemented an **AWS CodePipeline** that simplifies the process of uploading container products to the AWS Marketplace. Using **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** and **AWS CloudFormation**, I developed infrastructure templates to automate pipeline creation for customer use. This project provided valuable experience in cloud automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), and deploying containerized applications within AWS services.  

**Key Skills:** Kubernetes ¬∑ Amazon EKS ¬∑ AWS CodePipeline ¬∑ AWS CloudFormation

### WhatsTheWord Social Media App  
I am currently working on **WhatsTheWord**, a live-service social media app that bridges the gap between students and their campus networks.  
The app provides:  
- üìÉ **Personalized News Feeds** for updates tailored to user interests.  
- üí¨ **Lounge Rooms** where students can chat and collaborate.  
- üìÖ **Live Event Feeds** to keep students informed about campus happenings.  

Built with **React Native**, **JavaScript**, **Firebase**, and **Expo Go**, this app aims to enhance student engagement and connectivity.

### Neural Network Training on Housing Dataset  
In this project, I implemented two neural networks, a **Regressor** and a **Classifier**, to analyze the Boston Housing dataset.  
- The **Regressor** predicts the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1,000s).  
- The **Classifier** performs multi-class classification to predict digits from 0 to 9.  

This experience strengthened my understanding of machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and neural network architecture.  

**Key Skills:** Scikit-Learn ¬∑ Pandas ¬∑ Neural Network Design & Training
